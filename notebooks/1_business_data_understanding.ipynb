Where possible, try and make explicit the large-scale iterations in the machine learning process, for example, repetitions of the modeling and evaluation phases. As part of the project plan, it is also important to analyze dependencies between time schedule and risks. Mark results of these analyses explicitly in the project plan, ideally with actions and recommendations if the risks are manifested. Decide at this point which evaluation strategy will be used in the evaluation phase. Your project plan will be a dynamic document. At the end of each phase you’ll review progress and achievements and update the project plan accordingly. Specific review points for these updates should be part of the project plan.\n",
