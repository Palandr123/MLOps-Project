# MLOps-Project

## Installation guide
1. Create Python virtual environment (conda, venv, poetry)
2. Run the following command:
    ```sh scripts/install_requirements.sh```

## NOTE
We do not have requirements.txt file because pyproject.toml and poetry.lock are the replacements for it. We prefer to use Poetry and our TA confirmed that we can use it.
